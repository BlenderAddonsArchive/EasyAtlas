# EasyAtlas
A Blender addon for creating texture atlases.

EasyAtlas adds a "create atlas" button to Blender's render panel. Pressing the button will loop through all meshes in the scene creating new EasyAtlas UV sets and baking each object to a single EasyAtlas texture.

In dev, use at your own risk. ;D
